# Interactive Mandelbrot Set Visualization

The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous fractals in mathematics. In this post, we'll explore it both through static visualizations and an interactive notebook where you can experiment with different parameters.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that, when iterated through a specific function, remain bounded. It's famous for its intricate boundary and self-similar patterns at different scales.

## Interactive Exploration

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CuriousCaliBoi/CuriousCaliBoi.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/mandelbrot_visualization.ipynb)

Try the interactive notebook above to:
- Generate your own Mandelbrot set visualizations
- Adjust color schemes and parameters
- Zoom into different regions
- Experiment with different iteration counts

## Key Features

The notebook includes:
- Interactive parameter controls
- Real-time visualization updates
- Color scheme customization
- Region selection and zooming
- Performance optimization tips

## How to Use the Notebook

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button above
2. Run the cells in sequence
3. Adjust the parameters in the interactive widgets
4. Try different color schemes and zoom levels

## Mathematical Background

The Mandelbrot set is defined by the iteration:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

where $c$ is a complex number. The set consists of all values of $c$ for which the sequence remains bounded.

## Try It Yourself

The Colab notebook contains all the code and interactive visualizations. Feel free to:
- Modify the parameters
- Create your own color schemes
- Explore different regions
- Share your findings!

## Next Steps

In future posts, we'll explore:
- Other famous fractals
- Performance optimization techniques
- Advanced visualization methods
- Applications in computer graphics
