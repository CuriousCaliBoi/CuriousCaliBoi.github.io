# A Whole New World

Well I really enjoyed using claude code. The speed from thought to action was pretty remarkable. It still took a long time in a way but I was a lot more hand wavy and gave it a lot of control (Inspired by the continual learning stuff going on right now)

I got around to experimenting with Claude Code because I stupidly injured my back while doing split squats. While the uncertainty of my injury and its implications are a bit heavy for me to deal with (I should be fine, but with back injuries you never know), I've found in my life that making the most of unique circumstances not only breathes new life into oneself in terms of skills and outputs, but also helps me cope with the bad news in the first place.

I guess something something be like water xd
