It's ok to not do everything at once or to fail at your goals.Expanding ones perspective of what utility actually is gets us to see a rich and detailed  picture that illustrates the  progress happening. This has been really useful for me. I think it utilizes human psychology really effectively and is reminescent of breaking down a large and difficult goal into chewable manageable pieces. 

Once you haev identified some of the strengths you've built you can also reverse engineer how to leverage them better! Whats so interesting to me is humans don't even really understand themselves or other human beings in full detail. And that seems like its going to be true for the foreseeable future but gaining relatively more clarity can be really useful. Basically you're still going to be blind just less so.

One thing I always think about is the human body. Our gut microbiome is trillions of bacteria literally a universe of organisms cultivated by each micro action that we choose. to be honest theres so much I want to write about this but its not really fleshed out and its going to take time and effort bleh but basically agency is key fam. What are we actually capable of? Why is it scary almost to improve or engage with our best selves? FOOD FOR THOUGH but theres probably a meta skill about feeling comfortable with growth and the best way to improve is one step at a time xd
